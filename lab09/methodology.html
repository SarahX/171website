            <h2>Methodology</h2>

            <p>Instead of specifying variables and testing their impacts on the students’ experiences in workshops, our project focuses on obtaining personalized and specific feedback from each student within each workshop, and then aggregating the students’ responses to learn 1) their general attitude towards workshops, 2) their general attitudes towards the class and 3) what the workshop leaders needed to improve on to fulfill their students’ needs. We used the Start–Stop–Continue method of obtaining the feedback—students would fill out anonymous surveys in which they would specify what they wanted their workshop leaders to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing. They were then asked the same questions about the class, and then to rate 1) how much workshops contributed to their understanding of the course material and 2) the difficulty of the workshops on scales of 1-10. We have listed the survey questions more explicitly below:</p>

               We sent out these surveys three times during the course of the semester in order to also monitor changes in the students’ sentiments towards workshops/course as the semester progressed. The survey was administered in the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Administering the survey in this dynamic manner was beneficial for the three reasons. First, it allowed us to receive continuous feedback from our students on the quality of our workshops and its impact on their progress and success in the course. Second, it allowed us to make changes as workshop leaders and adjust certain aspects of our facilitating to improve the quality of our workshops. Finally, this structure allowed us to analyze whether the changes we made as leaders had tangible impacts on the quality of our facilitation and its subsequent impact on the academic performance and experience of our students.
