               Start Stop Continue is a survey method that allows the surveyor to ask specific yet open-ended questions and to receive concrete examples to act on (Hoon 2). Experiments surrounding the Start Stop Continue methodology have found that it is more helpful to the surveyors and more enjoyable for the people completing it. Studies like “A Comparison of the Usefulness for Teaching Improvement of Qualitative Feedback Data” by Burden have found that in less structured feedback methods, students wrote things that were less in-depth and not as helpful as when using a systematic setup like the one used by Stop Start Continue. A study by Alice Hoon also found that switching to a Start Stop Continue structure found an increase in the depth of responses. They also found that students also preferred the Stop Start Continue method.

            <p>The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1 Autocode". Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine. In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus. It was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959. FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.</p>
