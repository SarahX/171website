            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>Our results are summarized below. We averaged the respondents for each of three weeks for the following two questions: “How much does the workshop contribute to your comprehension of the class material” and “Please rate the difficulty of the workshops”. For the first week surveys, the students on average reported a comprehension of 6.2/10 and difficulty of 6.0/10. In the second week, students reported a comprehension of 6.8/10 and difficulty of 5.6/10. In the final weeks of our survey, respondents reported a comprehension level of 6.5/10 and a difficulty of 6.2/10. 
            </p>

            <p>In summary, our results inculcate that comprehension levels went up slightly from the beginning of the semester to the end, although not very significantly. Additionally, the difficulty of the material remained fairly consistent throughout the semester. Our interpretation of these findings is that Prof. Purtee was able to adjust the workshop material in the middle of the semester according to the feedback from his students. Ultimately, however, as the semester progressed, the material got more difficult due to the innate difficulty of the content from topics such as graphics and recursion. Regarding student comprehension of the material we found that workshops consistently contributed to a high level of comprehension even as the material got more difficult throughout the semester. </p>

               <li>
                  comprehension - 6.2, 6.8, 6.5
               </li>
               <li>
                  difficulty - 6.0, 5.6, 6.2
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Due to the subjective nature of the Start, Stop, Continue questions on the survey, we were unable to compile the data to yield solid, numerical results. However, the potential for the human interpolation of such personalized material presents an interesting future for this course. For example, it can be seen that the first survey results showed students wishing for WL’s to Start explaining concepts more in depth. When Workshop Leaders communicated that they had seen this feedback and worked to address it in future workshops, it should be noted that this statement showed up less in future surveys. Additionally, there was a request from students that concepts be explained “in code” during the workshops; as this is not a desired purpose for the workshops, the anonymous survey allowed for WL’s to address this concern of participants in a way that may not have been possible without this form of feedback.
