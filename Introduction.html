            <p>
               Start Stop Continue is a survey method that allows the surveyor to ask specific yet open-ended questions and to receive concrete examples to act on (Hoon 2). Experiments surrounding the Start Stop Continue methodology have found that it is more helpful to the surveyors and more enjoyable for the people completing it. Studies like “A Comparison of the Usefulness for Teaching Improvement of Qualitative Feedback Data” by Burden have found that in less structured feedback methods, students wrote things that were less in-depth and not as helpful as when using a systematic setup like the one used by Stop Start Continue. A study by Alice Hoon also found that switching to a Start Stop Continue structure found an increase in the depth of responses. They also found that students also preferred the Stop Start Continue method.

            <p>It is important to ask students to reflect on their educational experiences. This allows the instructor to gain insight into their students’ learning preferences. By using Stop Start Continue Structure, we will be able to get more constructive feedback from workshop participants.

               The implementation of Stop Start Continue that was used in this research was a survey that was given roughly every two weeks. After each survey, Workshop Leaders would review feedback and, at the next meeting, state to students what they would work on changing. Students were asked to give feedback specifically on the instructor, as well as the course at large. In this fashion, participants could be precise in what they did or did not like. Additionally, this aids in data analysis regarding the Workshop Leader progression of Stop Start Continue.
