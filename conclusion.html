            <h2 class="definition">Conclusion</h2>

            <p >In conclusion, our findings generated by the survey responses indicate that workshop leaders received generally positive feedback from their students. As the semester progressed, we did not identify any significant changes in the sentiments of the students towards workshops, the course, or collaborative learning in general throughout the semester. As the majority of students taking CSC 171 are freshman, this would likely have been the first time participating in a workshop based solely on collaborative learning for a majority of the students. We conducted our surveys in the latter half of the semester, by which time students would have begun to feel more comfortable in such a workshop setting. 
            </p>

            <p>Start, Stop, Continue feedback was received positively when workshop leaders actively responded and changed their facilitating strategies based on student feedback. In our case, each workshop leader was dedicated to ensuring that they created a safe environment for collaborative learning. Given the averages in the students’ responses to how well the workshops contributed to their comprehension of course material (greater than 6 for all three surveys), we concluded that the students found the workshops to be generally helpful in their understanding of material and their performance in the course. We also found that the Start Stop Continue method was helpful as a feedback tool and allowed Workshop Leaders to utilize that data to improve performance in workshops and in the course overall.</p>
